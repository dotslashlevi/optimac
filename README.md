# OptiMac
*OptiMac is an open source alternative to most big name apps which usually don't even improve speed. Formerly MacOS-Debloater.*

*This project was started by me in 2021, as I was sick of bad MacOS performance on old hardware. It's licensed under the MIT License.*

# How can I optimize my system?
*Note: You need SIP to be turned off.*

Open your terminal and type the following.

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotslashlevi/optimac/main/optimac.sh | bash
```
The Computer will then download and run the script.

You will need to reboot your system manually.

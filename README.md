# MacOS Debloater

*The MacOS debloater is an open source alternative to most big name apps which usually don't even improve speed.*

# How can I debloat my system?

*Note: You need SIP to be turned off.*

Click the green button that says "Code" with an arrow, then click Download ZIP.

Then you want to open your terminal and the following commands.

```
cd Downloads/

chmod +x macos-debloater

./macos-debloater
```

The Computer will then run the script, and your system will reboot.

# What does this script disable?

- Crash reporting

- Telemetry

- Location services

- Spindump

- FTP

- SMB1

# About this project.

This project was started by me in April 2021 because I was sick of bad MacOS performance on older hardware.

Newer versions of MacOS are getting harder to tweak though.

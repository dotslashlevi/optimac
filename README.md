# OptiMac

*OptiMac is an open source alternative to most big name apps which usually don't even improve speed. Formerly MacOS-Debloater*


# How can I debloat my system?

*Note: You need SIP to be turned off.*

*Also, I try to make commits stable. They also go through testing.*

Open your terminal and type the following commands.

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotslashlevi/optimac/main/optimac.sh | bash
```
The Computer will then download and run the script.

You will need to reboot your system manually.

Do it as soon as possible.

# Coming soon

- Remove extra default apps such as...
  - Chess
  - Photos 
  - Books
  - Home
  - Mail
  - News
  - Stocks
  - Grapher
  - DVD Player
  - etc.

- Remove closed source "cleaning software" because these apps can make your computer slower. Removes apps such as...
  - CleanMyMacX
  - AVG
  - CCleaner
  - etc.

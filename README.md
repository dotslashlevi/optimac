# MacOS Debloater

*The MacOS debloater is an open source alternative to most big name apps which usually don't even improve speed.*

# How can I debloat my system?

*Note: You need SIP to be turned off.*

*Also, I try to make commits stable, plus they go through testing.*

Open your terminal and type the following commands.

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotslashlevi/macosdebloater/main/macos-debloater.sh | bash
```
The Computer will then run the script. You will need to reboot your system manually.

# Coming soon

- Remove default apps

- Remove unwanted "antivirus" or "cleaning" software

# What does this script disable?

- Crash reporting

- Telemetry

- Location services

- Spindump

- FTP

- SMB1

- SMB2

- Location Services

- Siri

- Facial recognition in media

- NetBIOS

# About this project.

This project was started by me in April 2021 because I was sick of bad MacOS performance on older hardware.
